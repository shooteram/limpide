This theme is a modified version of the [_miloshadzic_](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/themes#miloshadzic) theme.  
Rather than using only the name of the current directory, I'm merging with it the name of the parent
    directory.  
It seems clearer to me since my project folder architecture is _tech/project_; so if a
     project uses different techs for the backend and the frontend, I can easily tell which one is the one I'm looking for.

For example: if I have a project named __broutilles__ which is a website I'd like to make, I'm choosing to make a SPA with Vue.js and use Laravel as its backend/api.  
My folder structure will be as follow:
* __~/work/laravel/broutilles__  
* __~/work/vue/broutilles__

It might seem weird to create that many directories instead of making two dirs into a
    parent folder named as the project but, I have a lot of projects and, I prefer to list them from the tech they use.  

Another particularity of this theme is the fact that I'm not using emojis. They don't appear the way I'd like with the font I'm using.
